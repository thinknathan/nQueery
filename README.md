#nQueery
nQueery is a wrapper for vanilla JavaScript functions. In order of priority, it aims to...

1. Be familiar and intuitive for jQuery users
2. Allow unneeded code to be stripped out on a per-project basis
3. Use the fastest methods (using [V8](https://developers.google.com/v8/) as the target JS engine)
4. Remain lightweight in file size

This is a pet project that is under construction. For now, you're better off using [Cash](https://github.com/kenwheeler/cash) or [Bliss](https://github.com/LeaVerou/bliss).
